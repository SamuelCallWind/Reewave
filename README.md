# Reewave
Task manager & scheduler

### Task manager & scheduler made with lots of Javascript

Instead of making the website in HTML and display or hide every element, I wanted to use JS to create the boxes to learn more about the language


## Updating along the way 
## Features: 
-Retrieve the information that are set in each box of the calendar
-Create new activities 
-Set an urgency for these activities to have them displayed more or less high
-error messages when the data provided doesn't fill all the necessary boxes 


## Features to do : 
-Implement the script for the two switches buttons "day" & "night" as well as the changes in the number for it 
-Let the uer have a local save of the calendar to be able to retrieve the info even when the browser is closed 
-Search Functionality to allow users to search for specific activities by type, length, or time of day.
-Allow users to set up events that repeat on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis
